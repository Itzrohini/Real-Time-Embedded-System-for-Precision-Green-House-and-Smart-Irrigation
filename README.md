# 🌱 REAL TIME EMBEDDED SYSTEM FOR PRECISION GREENHOUSE AND SMART IRRIGATION

This project presents a **real-time embedded system** integrating **IoT sensors** and **AI-based plant disease detection** to enhance smart irrigation and greenhouse management.  
It continuously monitors environmental and soil parameters like **temperature, humidity, pH, and soil moisture**, and uses **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)** to detect plant leaf diseases.
